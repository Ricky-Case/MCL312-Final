[p]You rest peacefully in your bed all night...[/p]
[p]A dark forest surrounds you when you open your eyes.[/p] [p]A flash of light catches your eye.[/p] [p]A glowing fox dashes through the trees ahead. You follow.[/p] [p]An eternity later, the fox stops running. So do you.[/p] [p]The fox looks up through the branches and leaves for a moment, glows brighter and vanishes.[/p] [p]You walk to the same spot, and look up.[/p] [p]One star glows in the sky above.[/p]
[p]A dark forest surrounds you when you open your eyes.[/p] [p]A flash of light catches your eye.[/p] [p]A glowing fox dashes through the trees ahead. You follow.[/p] [p]The fox enters a clearing. You halt at the treeline to watch.[/p] [p]The fox spirit effortlessly climbs to the top of a giant rock in the middle of the clearing.[/p] [p]The fox looks up at the sky, and then vanishes.[/p] [p]You enter the clearing and circle the rock, trying to climb up, but you can't seem to find a way.[/p] [p]Frustrated, you give up and gaze towards the sky where you see two stars glowing brightly above you.[/p]
[p]A rock partially obstructs your view when you open your eyes.[/p] [p]You're in the middle of a clearing.[/p] [p]On top of the rock sits a glowing fox. It's looking at you.[/p] [p]By the fox’s glow, you can see crevices in the rock.[/p] [p]You stand, walk to the rock, and climb.[/p] [p]When you’re finally standing on top of the rock, the fox has vanished, but you can still see somehow.[/p] [p]You look up to the sky above. Three huge stars glow back at you.[/p]
[p]You awaken in the clearing, no rock to be seen, the night sky glowing above.[/p] [p]As you stand, the glowing fox approaches you, and transforms into a person wearing a tunic, still glowing softly from within.[/p] [p]The glow-person smiles.[/p] [p]“I am Inari. You are truly gifted in the craft of tea. Take this. It will bless you as you have blessed me.”[/p] [p]A new flower sits in your hand, white and cup-shaped.[/p]
[p]You awaken in the clearing. Again.[/p] [p]You stand, looking around for the Inari-fox.[/p] [p]A hole opens in the ground in front of you. You jump back.[/p] [p]A woman climbs from the hole. She seems to suck the light from the stars above.[/p] [p]You hear her voice hissing in your head.[/p] [p]“I am Izanami, and you...you are Inari's chosen. You should not be here.”[/p]
