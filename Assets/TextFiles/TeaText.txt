[p]You can't seem to recall having any dreams last night...[/p] [p]Maybe you should try different ingredients.[/p]
[p]Recently, you've been having bizarre dreams, but you struggle to recall them after.[/p] [p]Try brewing some tea to focus your mind, so you can remember.[/p]
[p]You shake awake. What in the world?[/p] [p]You’ve never dreamed so clearly...[/p] [p]and it seemed like that fox knew you.[/p] [p]And the forest...It’s as if you’ve been there before.[/p] [p]Was it because of the tea you drank?[/p]
[p]You open your eyes slowly. What's going on?[/p] [p]Not only were you dreaming of the same place, but that fox was there again?[/p] [p]What could it all mean?[/p] [p]You need some relaxing tea to clear your head.[/p] [p]Maybe you'll have another dream tonight.[/p]
[p]You wake peacefully, slowly.[/p] [p]You feel as though you’re almost to the end of a long journey.[/p] [p]On the edge of a precipice...But you aren't scared.[/p] [p]You know what to do...[/p]
[p]Inari...? And they gave you some kind of special flower for your tea...[/p] [p]That can't have really happened, right?[/p] [p]Only...The flower is RIGHT THERE.[/p] [p]Maybe you should use it...[/p]
